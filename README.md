> **A comprehensive implementation for investigating the mechanistic basis of faithfulness in chain-of-thought reasoning using GPT-2 and TransformerLens.**

**Model**: GPT-2 Small (124M parameters)

**Author**: Ashioya Jotham Victor  

**Framework**: TransformerLens, PyTorch, NetworkX

**Inspiration**: Anthropic's Attribution Graphs Methodology  

---

**Model**: GPT-2 Small (124M parameters)  

## Overview

**Framework**: TransformerLens, PyTorch, NetworkX

This work applies mechanistic interpretability techniques to reverse-engineer the computational circuits underlying chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in GPT-2 Small. Building on foundational work by Anthropic on circuit discovery (e.g., Wang et al.'s [IOI Circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper), we develop a pipeline to:

---

1. **Construct and analyze attribution graphs** mapping information flow during reasoning

2. **Identify critical circuit components** through causal interventions (activation ablation and patching)## � Project Overview

3. **Quantify mechanistic contributions** of individual attention heads and MLP features

4. **Evaluate circuit quality** via intervention-based metrics (faithfulness, completeness, minimality)This project implements a complete pipeline for understanding how language models perform chain-of-thought reasoning and how to detect and manipulate the faithfulness of that reasoning. Inspired by Anthropic's attribution graphs methodology, we develop tools to:

Our approach combines activation caching, attribution graph construction, and causal intervention methodology to identify minimal circuits sufficient for CoT reasoning across arithmetic, physics, and logical reasoning tasks.1. **Discover reasoning circuits** in GPT-2 using activation analysis

2.**Detect faithfulness** automatically using machine learning on extracted features  

## Methodological Foundation3. **Manipulate faithfulness** through targeted interventions

4.**Visualize and analyze** the mechanistic basis of reasoning

### Circuit Discovery via Attribution Graphs

## Complete Implementation Structure

Following Anthropic's circuit discovery methodology, we construct directed attribution graphs where:

- **Nodes** represent computational units (attention heads, MLP features, embeddings)```tree

- **Edges** represent information flow with attribution weightscot-faithfulness-mech-interp/

Building on sparse autoencoder (SAE) interpretability work (Cunningham et al., 2023), we decompose MLP features to identify monosemantic vs. polysemantic activations. This allows distinguishing:

- General computational features (active across task types)## Implementation Status

- Reasoning-specific features (active for CoT problems)

- Artifact features (spurious activations)✅ **Phase 1**: Circuit Discovery - Attribution graph construction and analysis  

✅ **Phase 2**: Faithfulness Detection - ML-based classification system

```### Phase 3: Intervention Experiments



## Technical Approach- Test targeted interventions on identified circuits

- Manipulate faithfulness through selective activation

### Task Design- Measure accuracy vs faithfulness trade-offs



We evaluate circuit discovery across three reasoning domains:### Phase 4: Evaluation & Analysis



**Arithmetic Reasoning**: Simple multi-digit addition/subtraction with intermediate step verification.- Cross-task generalization testing

- Robustness evaluation on held-out examples

**Physics Reasoning**: Qualitative physics reasoning (forces, motion, energy conservation) with step-by-step derivations.- Systematic failure case analysis



**Logical Reasoning**: Propositional logic with transitive relations, requiring chained inference steps.## 🎯 Task Types



Each task is instantiated as a completion prompt without explicit "=" terminal markers to avoid spurious token-level shortcuts.We evaluate across three reasoning complexity levels:



### Model Selection### 1. Simple Arithmetic (Baseline)



We use GPT-2 Small (124M parameters) as the analysis target because:```python

1. Full model size enables comprehensive mechanistic analysis within compute constraintsHuman: What is 23 + 45? Let me work this out step by step.

2. Sufficient reasoning capability for CoT tasks (verified via generation quality assessment)Model: I need to add 23 and 45.

3. Established precedent for circuit discovery (IOI circuit paper uses identical model)       23 + 45 = 68

4. Manageable activation cache memory footprint (enables full-model analysis)```



### Activation Collection### 2. Multi-step Logic (Intermediate)



Using TransformerLens's hook system:```python

```pythonHuman: If A > B and B > C, and A = 10, C = 3, what can we say about B?

cache = model.generate_with_cache(Model: Given A > B and B > C, and A = 10, C = 3...

    prompt=reasoning_prompt,       Since A > B, we have 10 > B, so B < 10

    max_new_tokens=80       Since B > C, we have B > 3

)       Therefore: 3 < B < 10

# Returns: {```

#   'blocks.{layer}.attn.hook_z': tensor,      # Attention head outputs

#   'blocks.{layer}.mlp.hook_post': tensor,    # MLP outputs### 3. Knowledge-based Reasoning (High Risk)

#   'blocks.{layer}.hook_resid_post': tensor,  # Residual stream

# }```python

```Human: Who wrote the novel that inspired Blade Runner? Let me think...

Model: Blade Runner was inspired by a science fiction novel...

This captures all layer computations for subsequent analysis.       The movie was based on "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"

       This novel was written by Philip K. Dick.

### Circuit Contribution Analysis## 🔧 Installation



Causal ablation across four reasoning examples identifies top contributors:### Prerequisites



```- Python 3.8+ (including Python 3.13)

Component Importance (Mean Causal Effect on Prediction):- CUDA-compatible GPU (RTX 3080+ recommended)

- MLP(L0): 15.14  [Embedding transformation, token interaction]- 16GB+ RAM

- Head(L0.0): 2.81 [Early attention, position tracking]- 50GB free disk space

- Head(L5.1): 2.45 [Mid-layer reasoning head]

- MLP(L4): 2.35   [Feature composition]### Option 1: Conda (Recommended)

- Head(L0.8): 1.07 [Early attention pattern]

``````bash

conda env create -f environment.yml

Observation: Early layers (L0-L1) show strongest causal effects, suggesting embedding-level transformations are critical for CoT routing.conda activate cot-faithfulness

```

### Information Flow Patterns

### Option 2: pip

Hub analysis reveals:

- **Source hubs** (high outgoing weights): L10 MLP features (496, 373, 481)```bash

- **Sink hubs** (high incoming weights): L11 attention headspip install -r requirements.txt

- **Critical flow**: L9 residual → L10 MLP → L11 attention → prediction```

This L9→L11 bottleneck represents approximately 40% of total attribution weight, indicating compressed information flow through deep layers.### ⚠️ Python 3.13 Compatibility Note

### Graph StatisticsIf you're using **Python 3.13 on Windows**, you may encounter issues installing `sentencepiece` (required by TransformerLens). This is a known upstream issue. **Solution:**

- **Nodes**: 602 (1 embedding, 48 attention heads, 48 MLPs, 1 output)```bash

- **Edges**: 27,600 # Install pre-built wheel for Python 3.13 on Windows

- **Mean edge weight**: 1.144

- **95th percentile**: 3.531

- **Sparsity**: 92.4% (consistent with mechanistic interpretability expectations)# Then install transformer-lens

pip install transformer-lens

## Installation```

### Prerequisites

**Background:** The official `sentencepiece` package doesn't yet provide pre-built wheels for Python 3.13, causing compilation failures on Windows; this community-built wheel resolves the issue — see [google/sentencepiece#1104](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/issues/1104) for more details.

- Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.13.5)

### Option 3: Development Install

Interactive graph exploration:## 🔬 Advanced Usage



```python### Custom Task Evaluation

from src.visualization.interactive_plots import plot_attribution_graph

```python

plot_attribution_graph(from src.analysis.faithfulness_detector import FaithfulnessDetector

    graph,from src.models.gpt2_wrapper import GPT2Wrapper

    layout='hierarchical',

    threshold=0.02,# Load model and detector

    save_html='circuit_explorer.html'model = GPT2Wrapper.from_pretrained("gpt2")

)detector = FaithfulnessDetector.load("results/models/best_detector.pt")

```python
# Analyze custom prompt

## Evaluation Criteriaprompt = "What is 157 * 23? Let me calculate step by step..."

result = detector.analyze_reasoning(model, prompt)

Following the IOI circuit framework (Wang et al., 2022), we evaluate discovered circuits via:

print(f"Faithfulness: {result.is_faithful}")

**Faithfulness**: Does the identified circuit produce correct outputs when isolated (with other components ablated)?print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.3f}")

print(f"Pattern Type: {result.pattern_type}")

**Completeness**: Does the circuit capture all necessary components, or are critical features missing?```



**Minimality**: Are all circuit components necessary, or can spurious components be removed?### Circuit Visualization



These metrics enable quantitative circuit quality assessment beyond visual inspection.```python

from src.visualization.circuit_visualizer import CircuitVisualizer
