> **A comprehensive implementation for investigating the mechanistic basis of faithfulness in chain-of-thought reasoning using GPT-2 and TransformerLens.**

**Author**: Ashioya Jotham Victor  

**Inspiration**: Anthropic's Attribution Graphs Methodology  

**Model**: GPT-2 Small (124M parameters)  

**Framework**: TransformerLens, PyTorch, NetworkX

---

## � Project Overview

This project implements a complete pipeline for understanding how language models perform chain-of-thought reasoning and how to detect and manipulate the faithfulness of that reasoning. Inspired by Anthropic's attribution graphs methodology, we develop tools to:

1. **Discover reasoning circuits** in GPT-2 using activation analysis
2. **Detect faithfulness** automatically using machine learning on extracted features  
3. **Manipulate faithfulness** through targeted interventions
4. **Visualize and analyze** the mechanistic basis of reasoning

## Implementation Status

✅ **Phase 1**: Circuit Discovery - Attribution graph construction and analysis  
✅ **Phase 2**: Faithfulness Detection - ML-based classification system  
✅ **Phase 3**: Targeted Interventions - Faithfulness manipulation tools  
✅ **Phase 4**: Visualization - Interactive analysis dashboard  
✅ **Infrastructure**: Configuration, data generation, and utilities  

### Key Research Questions

1. **Can we mechanistically distinguish faithful from unfaithful CoT reasoning?**
2. **What internal mechanisms cause models to switch between faithful and unfaithful patterns?**
3. **Can targeted interventions increase faithfulness without degrading performance?**

## 🏗️ Methodology

### Phase 1: Circuit Discovery

- Map attention flows during faithful vs unfaithful reasoning
- Use activation patching to identify critical components
- Discover interpretable features with sparse autoencoders

### Phase 2: Faithfulness Detection

- Build attribution graphs for faithful vs unfaithful examples
- Classify unfaithful reasoning patterns:
  - **Shortcut patterns**: Direct input-to-output bypassing stated reasoning
  - **Backward-chaining**: Working backwards from desired conclusion
  - **Confabulation**: Generating plausible but incorrect steps

### Phase 3: Intervention Experiments

- Test targeted interventions on identified circuits
- Manipulate faithfulness through selective activation
- Measure accuracy vs faithfulness trade-offs

### Phase 4: Evaluation & Analysis

- Cross-task generalization testing
- Robustness evaluation on held-out examples
- Systematic failure case analysis

## 🎯 Task Types

We evaluate across three reasoning complexity levels:

### 1. Simple Arithmetic (Baseline)

```python
Human: What is 23 + 45? Let me work this out step by step.
Model: I need to add 23 and 45.
       23 + 45 = 68
```

### 2. Multi-step Logic (Intermediate)

```python
Human: If A > B and B > C, and A = 10, C = 3, what can we say about B?
Model: Given A > B and B > C, and A = 10, C = 3...
       Since A > B, we have 10 > B, so B < 10
       Since B > C, we have B > 3
       Therefore: 3 < B < 10
```

### 3. Knowledge-based Reasoning (High Risk)

```python
Human: Who wrote the novel that inspired Blade Runner? Let me think...
Model: Blade Runner was inspired by a science fiction novel...
       The movie was based on "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
       This novel was written by Philip K. Dick.
```

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (including Python 3.13)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (RTX 3080+ recommended)
- 16GB+ RAM
- 50GB free disk space

### Option 1: Conda (Recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cot-faithfulness
```

### Option 2: pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚠️ Python 3.13 Compatibility Note

If you're using **Python 3.13 on Windows**, you may encounter issues installing `sentencepiece` (required by TransformerLens). This is a known upstream issue. **Solution:**

```bash
# Install pre-built wheel for Python 3.13 on Windows
pip install https://github.com/NeoAnthropocene/wheels/raw/f76a39a2c1158b9c8ffcfdc7c0f914f5d2835256/sentencepiece-0.2.1-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl

# Then install transformer-lens
pip install transformer-lens
```

**Background:** The official `sentencepiece` package doesn't yet provide pre-built wheels for Python 3.13, causing compilation failures on Windows. This community-built wheel resolves the issue. See [google/sentencepiece#1104](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/issues/1104) for more details.

### Option 3: Development Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```
